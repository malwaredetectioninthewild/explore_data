## The documentation for the datasets and metadata released under  **[Malware Detection In the Wild Leaderboard](https://malwaredetectioninthewild.github.io/)**

We provide two notebooks to explore the dataset:

* **ReadMetadata.ipynb**: We explore the metadata stored in **metadata/hash_metadata.pkl**, and demonstrate how to obtain ground truth labels, family labels, and publisher labels (along with the labeling timestamps) from our metadata.

* **StandardizedDataFormat.ipynb**: We explain the standardized trace format that is used for our sandbox and endpoint datasets. Participants are be expected to provide detectors that can take traces in this format as input to make predictions.

To request access to our data please contact Yigitcan Kaya at **yigitcan at ucsb dot edu**

Once you download the datasets, extract the **metadata.zip** to create **hash_metadata.pkl** file under the **metadata** directory; and extract **sandbox_dataset.zip** to create our sandbox training datasets under **sandbox_dataset** directory.
